***Geospatial Analysis on the Impact on Covid on Airport Traffic**

My latest Power BI project focuses on the "Geospatial Analysis on the Impact of COVID-19 on Airport Traffic".

In this project, I leveraged Power BI's powerful geospatial capabilities to delve into the effects of the pandemic on air travel worldwide. Using interactive maps, I explored how airport traffic patterns have evolved amidst the global health crisis.

By visualizing airport traffic density during the pandemic, I uncovered significant shifts in travel behavior and highlighted the airports most affected by the downturn in passenger numbers. From major international hubs to regional airports, this report offers a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact on air travel infrastructure.

Furthermore, I analyzed flight route data to identify changes in connectivity between airports, shedding light on how travel restrictions and lockdown measures have reshaped global transportation networks. These insights are crucial for stakeholders in the aviation industry as they navigate the recovery phase and plan for the future of air travel.

Through interactive dashboards and visually compelling maps, this project aims to provide actionable insights for policymakers, airport operators, and industry professionals, facilitating informed decision-making in a rapidly changing landscape.
